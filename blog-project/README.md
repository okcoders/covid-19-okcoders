# blog project

## getting started

- clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:okcoders/covid-19-okcoders.git`
- ensure your current working directory is blog-project
- ensure you have docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed, if you do, you can get mongo up and running with the following

```
npm run setup-mongo
```

- if you do not have docker (try to install it, but if that fails just install mongo directly) you need to install mongo and get it running: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/


- now run the below to get started

```
npm run install-all
npm start
```
